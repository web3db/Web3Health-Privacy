        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          Web3Health is developed as part of academic research at the University
          of Georgia SensorWeb Lab. This policy explains what information the
          app collects, how it is used, and your choices.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We collect account information and the health data types you
            explicitly authorize on your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use that data to show you dashboards and to run sharing features
            you choose to use.
          </li>
          <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
          <li>
            You can revoke permissions and request export or deletion by email.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>

        <h3>1) Account and profile information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Email address and basic account identifiers required for sign-in and
            account management.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional profile fields you choose to provide (for example, a
            display name).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2) Health data (only with your permission)</h3>
        <p class="note">
          The app reads health metrics from your device only after you grant
          permission. If you do not grant permission, health dashboards may be
          empty and sharing features may not work.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Health metrics you authorize (for example: steps, distance, heart
            rate, sleep, and calories).
          </li>
          <li>
            Associated timestamps and summary values needed to display charts
            and compute selected time windows.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3) App and device information for reliability and security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Basic device and app information (for example, operating system
            version and app version) used for troubleshooting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diagnostics such as crash reports and error logs, if enabled in the
            build you are using.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4) What we do not intentionally collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We do not intentionally collect precise real-time location unless
            you add a feature that requires it and disclose it here.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not intentionally collect contacts, photos, microphone
            recordings, or camera content unless you add a feature that requires
            it and disclose it here.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Provide core functionality:</strong> show health dashboards
            and app screens, and operate features you choose to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sharing features you opt into:</strong> process your chosen
            sharing settings and time windows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research context:</strong> support academic research
            workflows where applicable, including aggregated reporting,
            consistent with your selections and this policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maintain and improve the app:</strong> debugging,
            reliability, performance, and security monitoring.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How information is shared</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        <p>We share information only in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service providers:</strong> vendors that process data on our
            behalf to provide the app. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Clerk</strong> (authentication and user management).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Supabase</strong> (backend services such as database and
                APIs).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When you choose to share:</strong> if you opt into a study,
            program, or sharing flow inside the app, we process and transmit the
            information required for that flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal and safety:</strong> if required to comply with law or
            valid legal process, or to protect users, the public, or the
            integrity of the service.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We use encrypted network connections (HTTPS/TLS) for data
            transmitted between the app and our backend services.
          </li>
          <li>We apply access controls to limit who can access data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          No system can be guaranteed 100% secure. If you believe your account
          has been compromised, contact us immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We retain information as needed to provide the service and for
            legitimate operational needs (for example, security, audit, and
            reliability).
          </li>
          <li>
            When you request deletion, we process it manually and will delete or
            de-identify data unless we must retain it for legal, security, or
            operational reasons.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Revoke health data permissions at any time through your device
            settings (for example, HealthKit on iOS or Health Connect on
            Android).
          </li>
          <li>
            Request access, correction, export, or deletion by emailing
            <a href="mailto:engr-sensorweb@uga.edu">engr-sensorweb@uga.edu</a>.
            At this time, deletion requests are processed manually.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          This app is not intended for children. If you believe a child has
          provided personal information, contact us to request deletion.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Last
          updated” date and, if changes are material, we may provide additional
          notice in the app or on this page.
        </p>
